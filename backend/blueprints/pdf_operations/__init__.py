# backend/blueprints/pdf_operations/__init__.py

# You can choose to import specific handlers here to make them available
# directly from the package, e.g.:
# from .merge_handler import handle_merge
# Or, the main blueprint will import them directly from their modules.
# For simplicity now, let's keep it empty or just list them for clarity.

# This file can also define a dictionary mapping operation names to handler functions
# which the main blueprint can use.
