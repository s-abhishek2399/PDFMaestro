    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How accurate are the PDF conversions (e.g., PDF to Word)?",
        answer: "We strive for the highest accuracy in all our conversions. However, PDF is a complex format primarily designed for viewing, not editing. The conversion quality, especially for formats like Word or Excel, can depend on the original PDF's structure. PDFs created from digital sources (rather than scanned images) generally convert best. For scanned PDFs, text extraction might be limited unless OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is available for that specific tool."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the typical file size limits?",
        answer: "To ensure optimal performance for everyone, we have file size limits that vary slightly per tool (e.g., 50MB for some conversions, 100MB for others like merging). These limits are generally quite generous for most common use cases. If you encounter an issue, please ensure your file is within the indicated limit on the tool's page."
      },
      {
        question: "How long can I download my processed files?",
        answer: "For your security, download links for processed files are active for a limited time, typically 1-2 hours. After this period, the files are permanently removed from our servers."
      },
      {
        question: "What if a tool doesn't work as expected?",
        answer: "While we test our tools thoroughly, PDF files can be very diverse. If you encounter an issue, please try the following: 1. Ensure your input file is not corrupted and is of the correct type. 2. Check if your file is within the size limits. 3. Try a different browser. If the problem persists, please feel free to reach out to our support â€“ we appreciate your feedback!"
